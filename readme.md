# datarock_test 
 this is the solution to questions specified in https://github.com/DiUS/coding-tests/blob/master/dius_shopping.md

 I have implemented the following using plain javascript and haven't used any framework as mentioned in institutions.

 I have used jest as a testing framework 

 # How ro run this solution

 1. Clone the repo using the git clone url and
 2. perform pm or yarn install to get jest dependencies
 3. functions and tests are differentiated using separate folders
 4. to run performBilling (function name) just run 'node index.js' in cli( modify input which is given as string array to see detailed output)
 5. to run test cases  just run 'npm run test' which will run 5 individual test cases written inside __test__ folder in root directory

 # Happy coding I guess
